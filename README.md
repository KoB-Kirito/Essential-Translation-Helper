# Essential Translation Helper
Can merge and edit translation files (intl.txt).  
A program specially designed to ease the process of updating the translation after a patch.

Uses the translation format of Pok√©mon Essentials. One file per language.  
But might work for other engines too which use this format:
```
[Section]
Original line 1 or KEY
Translated line 1
Original line 2 or KEY
Translated line 2
...
```
